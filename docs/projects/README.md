  <!-- We propose a novel fully hyperbolic model for molecular generation utilizing the junction tree auto-encoder framework.

  Many deep generators extract atomic relations from molecular graphs and ignore hierarchical information at both atom and molecule levels. In order to extract such hierarchical information, we propose a novel hyperbolic generative model. Our model contains three parts: first, a fully hyperbolic junction-tree encoder-decoder that embeds the hierarchical information of the molecules in the latent hyperbolic space; second, a latent generative adversarial network for generating the latent embeddings; third, a molecular generator that inherits the decoders from the first part and the latent generator from the second part. We evaluate our model on the ZINC dataset using the MOSES benchmarking platform and achieve competitive results, especially in metrics about structural similarity. -->
